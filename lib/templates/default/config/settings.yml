# Settings control internal forger behavior.
# Settings are different from the config files.  The config files are meant to
# expose config variables that you can use in your ERB code.
# There are separate files to separate user defined variables and internal

  # By setting s3_folder, forger will automatically tarball and upload your scripts
  # to set. You then can then use the extract_scripts helper method to download
  # the scripts onto the server.
