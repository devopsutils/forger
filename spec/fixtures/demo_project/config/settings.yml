# Settings control internal forger behavior.
# Settings are different from the config files.  The config files are meant to
# expose config variables that you can use in your ERB code.
# There are separate files to separate user defined variables and internal
# setting configs.
development:
  # By setting s3_folder, forger will automatically tarball and upload your scripts
  # to set. You then can then use the extract_scripts helper method to download
  # the scripts onto the server.
  # s3_folder: mybucket/path/to/folder # simple string
  # compile_clean: true # uncomment to clean
  # extract_scripts:
  #   to: "/opt"
  #   as: "ec2-user"
  # aws_profiles:
  #   - profile1

production:
  # s3_folder: mybucket/folder
  # aws_profiles:
  #   - profile2
